# superbank-android-app

A simple Android application of a bank-alike transaction system
__________________________________________

<<< The app works with Realtime Database provided by Backendless >>> 

To start an app with the Backendless realtime system you are required to register your application in Backendless -> https://backendless.com/ 
and to add your API_KEY, APPLICATION_ID and SERVER_URL values in /app/src/main/java/com/example/superbank/values/Defaults.java

__________________________________________

Supports: 
1) Signing in and up using Backendless UserService
2) Making transactions between accounts using Backendless API (SDK for Android)

__________________________________________

Raw version of app, still needs to be improved.
