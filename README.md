To work with the realtime system you have to create an application in Backendless -> https://backendless.com/ 
and to add your API_KEY, APPLICATION_ID and SERVER_URL values in /app/src/main/java/com/example/superbank/values/Defaults.java

Supports: 
1) Signing in ang up using BackendlessUserService
2) Making transactions between accounts using Backendless API (SDK for Android)

The app works with Realtime Database provided by Backendless.
